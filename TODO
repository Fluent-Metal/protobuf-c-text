Memory allocation:
  * Have broken malloc set a sentinal file which it removes when it makes
    malloc fail.  Loop until the sentinal file remains.
  * Script this for the tests:
    https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Allocation-Debugging.html

Error propogation:
  * Use TextFormatResult to propagate errors in generate.c.
  * Set error in TextFormatResult.  (done?)
  * Rename TextFormatResult to TextFormatError.

Documentation:
  * On the \mainpage provide the following:
    * An example .proto  (PonyCoptor class)
    * An example text format protobuf based on that.
    * Code to read and write it.
